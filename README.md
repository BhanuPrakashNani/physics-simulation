      This is a simple physics engine module made using pygame in python.
 
It is based on some physics phenomenon and mathematical expressions which defines movement after collision between particles,
gravitational force on partciles and spring function to make a chain of particles to work them as spring. for example: three 
particles together will act as triangle.

*To use this module in your file download it in the folder where you are working and import **PyParticle.py** in your file.*

**other files are example of using PyParticle, one just need to place pyparticle.py in current folder/directory.
No need to download other files**

Below all examples are created using PyParticle module which enables to write less number of lines code.

> **Some of the main features of this it defines the movement of particles
in space and provides ability to zoom-in and zoom-out**

>> ***This programm shows the effect on speed of particles after collision depending on their mass***

You can call its function by passing arguments using name of function 

             **Referred to example programs to see how to call the function in PyParticle module**
